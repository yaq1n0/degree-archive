<h3>
I. Examples of application modeling and analysing
</h3>

<ul>
<li> periodic.xml :  basic demonstration with a simple set of 3 independant periodic task
with a mono processor architecture
<li> multiprocessor.xml :  basic demonstration with a simple set of 3 independant periodic task
with a multi processor architecture
<li> rts03.xml :  demonstration presented during the conference RTS'2003
<li> demo_tni.xml : demonstration presented during a working group
			during a research contract between TNI
			and the LISyC Team
<li> pilot.xml : temporal validation of Pilot : a mobile robot
		control system designed by the EA 2215 team
<li> arin653.xml : Cheddar project described in the paper 
		published in the ACM SIGADA'04 (Atlanta)
</ul>


<h3>
II. Examples of user-defined schedulers 
</h3>

<ul>
<li> dm.sc : a file which implements the Deadline Monotonic
		scheduler
<li> rm.sc : a file which implements the Rate Monotonic
		scheduler
<li> edf.sc : a file which implements the Earliest Deadline
		First scheduler
<li> llf.sc : a file which implements the Least Laxity First
		scheduler
<li> hpf1.sc and hpf2.sc : two different ways to code a Highiest Priority
			First scheduler
<li> arinc.sc : modeling of a ARINC 653 partition scheduler
<li> schedule_according_to_criticity.parametric-cpu.sc : show how to define User's defined
		parameters : this scheduler is used by criticity.xml and schedule tasks
		according thier a criticity level
<li> non_preemptive_llf.sc (and its XML examples file non_preemptive_llf.xml) :
		Example of a LLF scheduler with no preemption when to tasks have the 
		same laxity value
<li> ts.sc : it's a time sharing scheduler. The processor is given to the task which
		ran the least frequently.
<li> fcfs.sc : First come/first served scheduling policy.
<li> short.sc : Schedule first the shortest job (with the smallest capacity)
<li> dvd0.parametric-cpu.sc : Dynamic value density scheduler of the York
		University (see docs/YCS-98-310.pdf)
<li> mllf.sc : Models "Modified Least Laxity First" with f=0.5;
		(see also mllf.xml and docs/brylawski.pdf)
<li> muf.sc : Maximum urgency scheduler (see also muf.xml and docs/sysengr91.pdf
<li> cyclic_executive.sc : example of a	off line scheduling of a set of task. The static scheduling is defined in this .sc file in order to generate a schedule of T1 and T2 as follows : T1, T2, T1, T1, T2, T1, ...
This .sc file works with cyclic.xml
</ul>


<h3>
III. Examples of user-defined event analyzers
</h3>

<ul>
<li> number_of_activations.sc : show how to compute the number of task activation
	from a scheduling simulation
<li> jitter.sc : compute from a scheduling simulation the jitter beetwen the ends
		of two tasks
<li> buffer_size.sc : compute from a scheduling simulation the number of byte
		in a buffer 
</ul>

<h3>
IV.  Examples of user-defined task model
</h3>

<ul>
<li> activations.sc : show how to define user defined static and dynamic task activations 
<li> random_capacity.sc : example of a task model with capacity varying randomly
	in a given time interval
<li> increasing_capacity.sc : example of a task model with capacity which is incremented
	at each task activation
<li> bursty.sc : example of a bursty task activation
<li> dynamic_activation.sc : a second example of dynamic task arrival pattern
<li> rm_auto.xml : an example of Rate Monotonic scheduler modeled with the Cheddar automaton language
</ul>



<h3>
V.  XML files tools
</h3>

<ul>
<li> cheddar_event_table.dtd : DTD of an event table exported by Cheddar
		(an event table is the data structur storing a scheduling
		into Cheddar).
<li> cheddar_project.dtd : DTD of an application modeled by Cheddar
<li> cheddar_project.xls and cheddar_project.ccs : necessary files 
		to display a XML Cheddar project file with an Internet
		browser.
</ul>
