Cheddar is a real time scheduling analysis tool. This program provides services to 
check schedulability of architectures models.


With Cheddar, you can :  

	- Draw scheduling with usual real time schedulers 
	- Compute task response times 
	- Compute processor utilization factor
	- Check for a given scheduling period, if deadlines are met.
	- Compute blocking time on shared resources.
	- Give information on buffer requirement.
	- ...
