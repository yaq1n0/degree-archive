# degree-archive 
### A repository of the projects that were noteworthy enough to be mentioned but not self-contained or large enough to have their own repository. 

# Why not just upload the entire backup of all the files related to my degree? 
I initially thought about just uploading my entire degree archive as-is but decided against this for several reasons. 

- It's organized by year then by module and that's about it, there's everything from revision files to lecture slides in there and not all of it is code. 
- It contains private information or proprietary code that I am not allowed to publish on GitHub
- It contains exam/assessment solutions that I am not allowed to publish on GitHub. 

# So what's in this repository? 
After realizing that no one would bother sifting through 3 years worth of data, I decided to sift through it myself and select the parts I wanted to highlight. 

Following this I organized and sanitized the data to highlight the skills demonstrated by the completion of these courseworks. 

Lastly, I had to go through everything to make sure that nothing the university provided (course specifications etc) was still present and nothing I wasn't allowed to upload was present (exam/assessment solutions) 

# Can I run these files? 
In theory, everything here should work, as they are "submission-ready" but a lot of this is environment-sensitive, meaning that it will take some effort to get it working for any particular environment. 

# What exactly is in these folders?  

The folders are named following the schema of `<module_name> - <coursework_summary>`. The summary should give a general idea of what the project is about and what skills it demonstrates.
